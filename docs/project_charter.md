# Project Charter for *Fridge Planner (Temporary Name)*
## Aim

This project will help anybody to register what they have in their fridge, what recipes they know, and what they need to buy to manage them.

## Scope

This project will let users register what ingredients they have in their fridge, so they can keep track of what they need to buy to eat. Users will be able to register the recipes they know, or they can share them for everyone to see and pick. The app will already come with a set of pre-loaded ingredients, to make picking ingredients easier. Users will be able to "plan" recipies they want to make, so they can check which ingredients they don't have, and generate a shopping list that takes care of all missing ingredients.

The application will require manual input by the user, so they will need to keep track of what they take out on the app for it to work properly.
